# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

### About this project
This project is a Datacamp project. The goal in this project was to utilize machine learning techniques to predict whether a credit card application was accepted or rejected.

### Technologies 
This project is coded in Python. Libraries used include: 🐼pandas | 🧮numpy | 🧠scikit-learn 

### Challenges
This project was my first solo machine learning project, so there were bound to be some hurdles. I enjoyed the process of utilizing what I had just learned in Datacamp's "Supervised Learning with scikit-learn" course. For my next machine learning project, I hope to increase my confidence and solidify my knowledge of scikit-learn!
