# Evolution of Lego

### About this project
This project is an unguided Datacamp project. In unguided projects, coders are provided with datasets and problems, and they must clean and analyze the data to come up with answers. I enjoyed diving into a more open Datacamp project that allowed me to utilize logic and creativity more than guided projects do.

### Technologies 
This project is coded in Python. Libraries used include: üêºpandas
